# Hashtables

*Author: Allyson Reyes*

---

### Problem Domain
Within the hashtable class, there are four functions of `Add()`, `Hash()`, `Get()`, and `Contains()`.
1. For Add we are adding the key/value pair into the bucket
2. Hash is hashing the given key
3. Get gets the value of the given key
4. Contains returns a boolean if the key exists in the Bucket or not.

### Inputs and Expected Outputs

If the key/value is: "hello", "world", in the get method,

| Input | Expected Output |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| "hello" | "world"|
